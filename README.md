Hi! Welcome to my quant finance projects. I am going to be creating the following:
1) Some algos for QuantConnect
2) An investing strategy using lagged return data
3) An LLM for text analysis to derive relative equity valuation related data from research reports
4) ML Projects for textual analysis
5) And so on!

I will be updating this on a regular basis.

I hope you like going through my repository and if you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to me either on LinkedIn or my email- vedant.sharma@yale.edu.

Thank you for reading this!
